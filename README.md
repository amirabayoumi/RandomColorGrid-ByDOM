# Random Color Grid Generator

This project is a **Random Color Grid Generator** created using JavaScript (DOM manipulation).
It allows users to generate a grid with random colors based on input dimensions and display the frequency of each color.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Generation:** Create a grid by specifying the number of columns, rows, and colors.
- **Random Color Palette:** Generate a palette of random colors and populate the grid.
- **Color Frequency Counter:** Display the frequency of each color in a separate static grid.
- **Interactive UI:** Users can input grid dimensions and the number of colors via a form.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [randomcolor](https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor) library

## How It Works

1. **Input Dimensions and Colors:**
   - Fill out the form by entering:
     - Number of columns (`#gridColumn`).
     - Number of rows (`#gridRow`).
     - Number of colors (`#gridColors`).

2. **Generate Grid:**
   - The application creates:
     - A **dynamic grid** filled with random colors.
     - A **static grid** showing each palette color and its frequency.

3. **Color Display:**
   - The dynamic grid displays the colors arranged randomly.
   - The static grid shows each palette color with its occurrence count.
